# ML-Project-Mammogram-masses-prediction  

This is personal project while working with prediction a Mammogram mass is either benign or melignant. The main goal of this project is apply a range of popular machine Learning model/algorithm and observe their performance. While I applied, 
* Logistic Regression 
* Decision tree 
* Random forest 
* KNN 
* Naive Bayes 
* SVM 
* Neural network.  

Any suggestion regarding this project for its improvement is always welcome. email: saidul.rnd@gmail.com
