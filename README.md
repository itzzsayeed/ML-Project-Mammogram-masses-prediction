# ML-Project-Mammogram-masses-prediction  

This is personal project while working with prediction a Mammogram mass is either benign or melignant. The main goal of this project is apply a range of popular machine Learning model/algorithm and observe their performance. While I applied, 
* Logistic Regression 
* Decision tree 
* Random forest 
* KNN 
* Naive Bayes 
* SVM 
* Neural network.  

While, Logistic Regression and Neural networks performed better than other models we experimented.

Thank you for you time. Any suggestion regarding this project for it's improvement is always welcome. email: saidul.rnd@gmail.com
